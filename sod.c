/*Ujan is a software developer. He is developing a software that takes two integers L and R and outputs the count of integers in the sequence L,L+1,…,R−1,R whose sum of digits (SOD) is divisible by 3.

He has developed the user interface (UI) quite easily. He is having a hard time finding the logic to solve the problem. As you are not only a good friend of Ujan but also a good problem solver, he asks you to help him out.

Can you solve the problem for your friend, Ujan?

Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains two integer L,R.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer equal to the count of of integers in the sequence, whose sum of digits is divisible by 3 .

Explanation
Test case 1: The numbers are 139, 140 and 141. Their sum of digits is 13, 5 and 6 respectively. So, only 141 is the number that has its sum of digits divisible by 3.*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	// your code goes here
	int t;
	scanf("%d",&t);
	for(int i=0;i<t;i++){
	    long long l,r;
	    scanf("%lld %lld",&l,&r);
	    long long d=(r/3)-((l-1)/3);
	    printf("%lld\n",d);
	}
	return 0;
}
